# rs-tick

A simple command-line tool as a countdown timer, i personally use it for Pomodoro Technique.

When the countdown ends, `rs-tick` will play the sound：`Your job should be down.`


# how to use it

build:

```
cd rs-tick
cargo build

```


# usage

```
./rs-tick 10s # 10 seconds countdown 

./rs-tick 25m # 25 minutes countdown 🍅
```
